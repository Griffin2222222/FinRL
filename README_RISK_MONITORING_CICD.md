# FinRL Productionization: Risk Management, Monitoring, CI/CD, and Documentation

## 1. Risk Management: Real-World Controls

- **Max Drawdown:**
  - Track portfolio value and halt trading or reduce risk if drawdown exceeds a threshold.
  - Example: Add to your environment's `step` function:
    ```python
    if (current_portfolio_value - peak_value) / peak_value < -max_drawdown:
        # Take action: halt trading, reduce risk, or liquidate
    ```
- **Position Limits:**
  - Prevent positions > X% of portfolio or per asset.
- **Slippage:**
  - Simulate slippage in backtests by adjusting fill prices (e.g., price ± random or fixed %).
- **Stop-Loss/Take-Profit:**
  - Enforce stop-loss and take-profit logic in the environment step function.

## 2. Monitoring & Logging

- **Persistent Logging:**
  - Use Python’s `logging` module to write logs to file (not just console).
    ```python
    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(filename='finrl.log', level=logging.INFO)
    logging.info('Backtest started')
    ```
- **Alerting:**
  - Integrate with email, Slack, or other services for error/threshold alerts.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Track key metrics (PnL, drawdown, trades, errors) and plot or dashboard them.

## 3. CI/CD & Deployment

- **Automated Testing:**
  - Use `pytest` for unit/integration tests. Run tests on every commit (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.).
- **Deployment:**
  - Use Docker for reproducible environments. Set up scripts for deployment and rollback.
- **Continuous Integration:**
  - Add a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for automated linting, testing, and build.

### Example `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
```

## 4. Documentation

- **Code Comments:**
  - Ensure all new functions/classes are documented with docstrings.
- **README Updates:**
  - Add usage examples for new features and APIs.
- **Config Docs:**
  - Document all config options and environment variables.
- **Workflow Guides:**
  - Add a `docs/` section or markdown files for setup, training, and deployment.
